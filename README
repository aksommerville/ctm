=== 1. INSTALLATION ===

From the command line, in the directory containing this README:
$ make install

This will build everything if necessary, and drop all the files under /usr/local.
To install somewhere else, edit etc/tool/install, around line 27 ("PFX").

If it doesn't print any error messages, you can now enter "ctm" to play.

In the inconceivably-unlikely event that you should ever want to remove the 
installed CTM, come back to this directory and enter:
$ make uninstall

Building and installation has been tested on Raspberry Pi (Raspian) and MacOS (10.10.1).
It should also work on any desktop Linux distro, but I don't have one set up at the moment for testing.
There's a chance that it will also work on Windows, with MinGW. I refuse to test this!

=== 2. HOW TO PLAY ===

You are the resurrected mummy of an ancient Egyptian pharoah, and you're running for president of the USA.
In a multi-player game, you may choose to play against your mates or against the Werewolf.
One-player games are always against the Werewolf.

Mummies may belong to the Blood Party (red) or the Frostbite Party (blue).
There's no real difference between parties, except Frostbite starts in Hawaii and Blood in Virginia.
Every voter has an opinion, and when the time runs out, will cast his vote.

In our crazy version of the United States, there are only 9 states, with equal electorate representation:
  Alaska (AK), home of white shirts. White like snow!
  Wisconsin (WI), home of yellow shirts. Yellow like cheese!
  Vermont (VT), home of green shirts. Green like mountains!
  California (CA), home of gray shirts.
  Kansas (KS), home of gray shirts.
  Virginia (VA), headquarters of the Blood Party and home of red shirts. Red like lovers!
  Hawaii (HI), headquarters of the Frostbite Party and home of blue shirts. Blue like water!
  Texas (TX), home of black shirts. Black like oil!
  Florida (FL), home of gray shirts.

There are seven shirt colors among American voters, and this is the game's only demographic distinction.
RED and BLUE shirts start off with a bias towards that color party.
All other colors start off more-or-less neutral.

You can influence the voters' opinions a few different ways:
    + Stand near them for a little while.
   ++ Enter their minds as a ghost.
 ++++ Throw money at them.
   ++ Kill vermin (cats, racoons, etc) near them.
  +++ Make a speech where they can hear it.
   -- Kill humans or mummies near them.
 ---- Kill enough humans to attract police attention. (statewide)

If you can't change a voter's mind, you can also kill him.
As in most US elections, dead voters don't vote.

Every state and every color has a radio station.
In these, you can pay $5 to make a speech which will reach all voters in that state, or wearing that color.

After receiving an opinion shift, a voter is numb for about a second.
During this time, the voter tints towards the color he shifted towards.

Press PAUSE at any time to view a state-by-state summary, and detailed opinion 
polls of the state you are in. These polls can lag by a few seconds.

If you kill too many humans too fast, the police may be called.
Once this happens, the state immediately shifts opinion hard against you, and policemen will appear.
It's unsafe to remain in a state where you are Wanted.

Each state has a Governor Monster. If you kill it, you get a fabulous prize.

Inside some houses, you will find coins and speeches.
These are laid out at random when the game begins, and do not reappear.

When all mummies are in the same party, they play against the Werewolf.
Werewolf controls the press, and he will occasionally print stories favorable to himself.
These stories can be scoped to a particular state or color, or they may reach everybody.
Check the newspaper name and read the headline carefully to know the impact.

=== 3. INPUT MAPPING ===

Each detected input device maps to a player.
(Multiple players per device is not supported).

The game has 8 two-state buttons per player, and 1 global action.
Each player has 4 directional buttons: UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT
...and 3 buttons for items: PRIMARY,SECONDARY,TERTIARY
...and a "PAUSE" button.
There is also a "QUIT" button, not necessarily associated with a player.

!! BEWARE !!
Hitting the QUIT button terminates the program immediately.

After installation, the input map is stored at /usr/local/share/ctm/input.cfg
This is a plain text file, whose format is described therein.
If an unknown device is detected, CTM will choose a default map and dump its text to the console.
Copy and paste that text into /usr/local/share/ctm/input.cfg, and modify as needed.

=== 4. DEFAULT KEYBOARD MAP ===

For SDL and X11 builds (ie desktop PCs), this can't be changed. I'll get around to that eventually.
For Raspberry Pi, this is only the default and can be modified any time CTM is not running.

ESC     => QUIT
ENTER   => PAUSE
SPACE   => PAUSE
H,J,K,L => LEFT,DOWN,UP,RIGHT (like vim!)
Z,X,C   => PRIMARY,SECONDARY,TERTIARY
ARROWS  => UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT

Numeric Keypad:
8,4,6,5,2   => UP,LEFT,RIGHT,DOWN,DOWN
0,DOT,ENTER => PRIMARY,SECONDARY,TERTIARY

=== 5. KNOWN BUGS ===

- It is possible though unlikely for players to spawn in unreachable places.
- Keyboard input is not configurable for SDL and X11 drivers.
